# Agora

## What is Agora?

AgoRa is an application that connects K-12 education to the real world through a learner-directed approach that offers Gamified Learning Experiences to guarantee increased engagement and excitement while learning.

## How it works?
* First the student scans an object through the mobile camera.
* Then an interactive Augmented Reality learning experience that is related to that object starts.
* Through interacting and playing the student reaches the learning outcome intended from the experience.

## Why scan Objects?

### From an academic perspective
When children scan an object that they see and use everyday, then the learning outcome delivered through that objects will be familiar to them. This will help children connect education to the real world and gain solid knowledge.
### From a technological perspective
Using real life objects as triggers for augmented reality gives children more freedom. The alternative is buying or printing QR codes and that is very limiting. Scanning real life objects gives children the ability to learn anywhere and anytime without any restrictions.

## Deployment

Android devices with version 7.0 or later.
* Check the ARCore supported devices from this link : https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices

## Technologies & Tools
The program was developed by : 
* A game engine called [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) - Unity Game Engine used as the base engine to build the app. 

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional, 
two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences.
* [Vuforia](https://engine.vuforia.com/engine) 

Vuforia is an augmented reality software development kit (SDK) for mobile devices that enables the creation of augmented reality applications.

## Machine Learning
Agora uses everyday objects to trigger an Augmented Reality learning experience. That’s why we use a special Machine Learning construct called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect the presence of these objects in the current scenery. The presence of each specific object triggers a certain learning experience thus linking our everyday life to the app’s learning experience.

### Notes
* This version of agora is working on unity3d 2019.2.2f1
