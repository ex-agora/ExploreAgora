    to enable you to interact in shared worlds, seamlessly blended with the real world.
    To do that, we need information about you. Protecting your privacy is really important
    to us. We only use your information where we have a legal basis to do so. This
    Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we collect, how we use
    it and what choices you have when you play any of our games, use our websites,
    buy merchandise from us, or take part in live events and promotions (the \"Services\").\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nPlease
    note that in addition to the general information below, specific information about
    how certain of our Services use your information is provided at the end of this
    Privacy Policy in the \u201CGame Specific Disclosures\u201D.\r\n\r\nYou should
    also read our Terms of Service which set out the contract between you and Hypatia.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\n1.
    Who decides how your information is used?\r\n\r\nHypatia, Inc. is the data controller
    responsible for making decisions about how we use your personal information.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have any questions or comments on this policy, you can:\r\n\r\nEmail us at
    support@exploreagora.com\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\n2. The information we collect about
    you and how we use it\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nThis Privacy Policy covers our use
    of any information that can or could be used to identify you or your child or
    your household (\"Personal Data\"). It does not cover information which cannot
    be used to identify you (\"Anonymous Data\").\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nWe need to
    collect and use certain Personal Data to provide the Services to you and fulfil
    the promises we make to you in the Terms of Service:\r\n\r\nWhen you sign up for
    our Services you give us Personal Data voluntarily by providing it to us, for
    example when you sign up for an account. We collect and use that information in
    order to authenticate you when you register an account and use the Services, to
    make sure you are eligible and able to receive the Services, and so that you receive
    the correct version of the Services. That information includes the in-game username
    you choose to use on our Services, and internal account IDs that we assign to
    your account.\r\n\r\nYou must have an account with a supported external single
    sign-on service to use our Services. As such, the Personal Data we collect also
    depends on which external accounts you choose to use, their privacy policy, and
    what your privacy settings with those services allow us to see when you use their
    services to access Hypatia Services.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nDepending on the particular
    Service you sign up for, we may support other external single sign-on services
    and collect additional Personal Data from them. For details please read the Game
    Specific Disclosures at the end of this Privacy Policy.\r\nSome external providers
    may notify you that they make additional information, such as your public profile,
    available to us when you use their single sign-on services. We do not collect
    that information from them.\u200B\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nWe also collect and use
    your in-game actions and achievements, as well as certain information about your
    mobile device (including device identifiers, device OS, model, configuration,
    settings and information about third party applications or software installed
    on your device), to operate the Services for you\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nWe further
    use the information above in order to provide technical and customer support to
    you.\r\n\r\n\u200B\u200B\r\n\r\nYou also give us Personal Data when you make a
    purchase through us, subscribe to our publications, register for a live event,
    enter a competition, promotion, sweepstakes or survey or communicate with us.
    Depending on which of these Services you use, that may include your name, mailing
    address, phone number, country of residency, date of birth (as needed to verify
    eligibility), and email address. We use that information to fulfil those Services
    to you and to provide related customer support to you.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nIn
    addition, we have and rely on a legitimate interest in using your Personal Data
    as follows:\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nUsing your IP address, browser type, operating
    system, the web page you were visiting before accessing our Services, the pages
    of our Services which you browsed or the features you used, and the time spent
    on those pages or features, the links on our Services that you click on, device
    and advertising identifiers, as well as actions you take during gameplay, your
    in-game user settings and preferences and your in-app purchases to understand
    who is using our Services and how.\r\n\r\n\u200B\u200B\r\n\r\nUsing your contact
    information, namely your email address in order to communicate with you to provide
    technical and customer support.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nUsing your internal account
    ID in order to attribute to your account any user content that you elect to submit
    to Hypatia through the Services.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nUsing your email address
    and device information in order to share updates and news about the Services with
    you either within the games or by email. You can unsubscribe from these at any
    time in your device settings or in-app settings.\r\n\r\n\u200B\u200B\r\n\r\nTo
    provide social features within our games so you can interact and play with other
    players, including storing your communications with those players, find your friends
    and be found by them, and share your gameplay experience and achievements with
    your friends.\r\n\r\n\u200B\u200B\r\n\r\nTo offer new or additional features for
    our Services.\r\n\r\n\u200B\u200B\r\n\r\nTo organize and run live events based
    on or featuring our games. Note that when you participate in live events your
    in-game actions and achievements, in-game username and your avatar, team, and
    other components of your in-game profile will be visible to other event participants
    and to the public (for example on leaderboards displayed at the event and online).\r\n\r\n\u200B\u200B\r\n\r\nUsing
    your in-game actions and achievements, as well as certain information about your
    mobile device (including device identifiers, device OS, model, configuration,
    settings and information about third party applications or software installed
    on your device), to carry out anti-fraud and anti-cheating measures against behaviors
    prohibited under our Terms of Service, to ensure that we provide a fair gaming
    experience to all players.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nTo make legal or regulatory disclosures
    and to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nIf you
    elect to add information about Hypatia live events to your mobile calendar, we
    will, with your permission, access your device\u2019s calendar and write in these
    events. We do not access or collect any other information from your calendar.
    You can change your mind and disable access to your calendar at any time in your
    device settings.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nSend you marketing materials by email or
    via in-app notifications. You can unsubscribe from these at any time in your device
    settings or in-app settings.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\n3. Who we share information
    with\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nWe will not share any Personal Data that we have collected
    from or regarding you except as described below:\r\n\r\nInformation Shared with
    Our Service Providers. We engage external service providers to work with us to
    administer and provide the Services. As part of that they will process your Personal
    Data on our behalf. These external service providers have access to your Personal
    Data only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf, in compliance
    with this Privacy Policy, and we make sure each one is contractually obliged not
    to disclose or use your Personal Data for any other purpose. The service providers
    we use help us to:\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nrun, operate and maintain our mobile games
    through third party platform and software tools;\r\n\r\nperform content moderation
    and crash analytics;\r\n\r\nrun email and mobile messaging campaigns;\r\n\r\nperform
    game and marketing analytics;\r\n\r\nadminister live events, competitions, sweepstakes
    and promotions, including registering players, managing check-in and attendance,
    verifying eligibility and prize fulfilment;\r\n\r\nprovide technical and customer
    support; and\r\n\r\nprocess payments for live events ticketing or other purchases.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nSome
    external service providers may also collect information directly from you (for
    example, a payment processor may request your billing and financial information)
    as a Third Party Service in accordance with their own privacy policy. Such external
    service provider does not share your financial information, like credit card number,
    with Hypatia, but it may share limited information with us related to your purchase,
    like your zip or postal code.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nInformation Shared with Third
    Parties. We share Anonymous Data with third parties for industry and market analysis.
    We may share Personal Data with our third-party publishing partners for their
    direct marketing purposes only if we have your express permission. We do not share
    Personal Data with any other third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\r\n\r\nInformation
    Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We cooperate with government
    and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the
    law. We only share information about you to government or law enforcement officials
    or private parties when we reasonably believe necessary or appropriate: (a) to
    respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas and warrants); (b) to protect
    our property, rights, and safety and the property, rights, and safety of a third
    party or the public in general; and (c) to investigate and stop any activity that
    we consider illegal, unethical, or legally actionable.\r\n\r\nInformation Disclosed
    in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect from our
    users, including Personal Data, is a business asset. If we are acquired by a third
    party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale
    or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business
    or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your Personal Data,
    will be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with
    the transaction.\r\n\r\n4. How your Personal Data is transferred\r\n\r\nHypatia
    operates its Services across the globe. Your Personal Data will very likely be
    transferred and stored in a country outside of your home country, including in
    the USA, for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. The data protection
    laws in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.\r\n\r\nIf
    we transfer your Personal Data from the EEA to other countries, including the
    USA, we ensure that a similar degree of protection is provided to your Personal
    Data as within the EEA by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards
    is implemented:\r\n\r\nThe country that your Personal Data is transferred to is
    a country that the European Commission has deemed to provide an adequate level
    of protection for Personal Data as the EEA.\r\n\r\nWe use specific contracts approved
    by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection as it
    has in Europe when we engage with service providers.\r\n\r\nWhere we engage with
    service providers in the USA, they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield, which
    requires them to provide the same protection of your Personal Data as it has in
    the EEA.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\n5. How we keep your Personal Data safe\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nWe
    have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your Personal Data from
    being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, improperly altered
    or disclosed. We also limit access to your Personal Data to employees, agents,
    contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will
    only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a
    duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected
    Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach
    where we are legally required to do so.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\n6. How long we will
    keep your Personal Data\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nWe keep your Personal Data for as
    long as we need to provide the Services to you and fulfil the purposes set out
    in this Privacy Policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information
    with and who carry out services on our behalf.\r\n\r\nWhen we no longer need to
    use your Personal Data and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our
    legal or regulatory obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or
    anonymize it so that it can no longer be associated with you. When removing Personal
    Data, we will take commercially reasonable and technically feasible measures to
    make said Personal Data irrecoverable or irreproducible.\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\n7.
    Your rights and choices\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nYou have certain rights in relation
    to your Personal Data. In order to exercise these rights, please contact us at:\r\n\r\nsupport@exploreagora.com\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nYou
    can:\r\n\r\nRequest access to the Personal Data we hold on you by emailing support@exploreagora.com\r\n\r\nDelete
    or correct your Personal Data. The easiest way to update your account information
    is via your in-app settings. \r\n\r\nObject to us processing your Personal Data.
    Some of the Personal Data we hold is necessary for us to provide the Services
    to you and fulfill the promises we make to you in the Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nAsk
    us to stop using your Personal Data, including for marketing and promotional purposes
    (but be aware that sometimes we need to use your Personal Data in order for you
    to use the Services).\r\n\r\nHave your Personal Data transferred to another organization
    (where it is technically feasible).\r\n\r\nThe law provides exceptions to these
    rights in certain circumstances. Where you cannot exercise one of these rights
    due to such an exception, we will explain to you why.\r\n\r\nWe offer you choices
    regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data and we\u2019ll
    respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us
    with the Personal Data that we request, you may not be able to access all of the
    features of the Services.\r\n\r\nAfter you contact us, you may receive an email
    in order to verify your request. We aim to provide the information or complete
    the outcome you request within 30 days.\r\n\r\n8. Children\r\n\r\nUnless stated
    otherwise for a particular Service, children are not allowed to use the Services,
    and we do not collect Personal Data from them. We define \u201Cchildren\u201D
    as follows:\r\n\r\nResidents of the EEA: anyone under 16 years old, or the age
    needed to consent to the processing of personal data in your country of residence.\r\n\r\nResidents
    of the Republic of Korea, anyone under 14 years old.\r\n\r\nResidents of other
    regions: anyone under 13 years old\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\n8 Collection of Data\r\n\r\n\u200B\r\n\r\nPersonal
    Data Collected\r\nWe use technologies like cookies on our website (small files
    stored by your browser or operating system), web beacons, or unique device identifiers
    to anonymously identify your computer or device. Our systems also logs information
    like your browser, operating system, IP address and anonymous usage data so we
    can deliver a better experience. We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal
    identification information to others.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNon-personal Data\r\nFor
    purposes of this Privacy Policy, \"non-personal data\" means information that
    does not directly identify you. Additionally, non-personal data means \"aggregate\"
    and \"de-personalized\" information, which is data Hypatia collects about the
    use of Explore AgoRa users, from which any personally identifiable data has been
