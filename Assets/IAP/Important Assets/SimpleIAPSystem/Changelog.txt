  (added comment blocks again, which you have to remove before using it)

v4.0
THIS VERSION IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE
- NEW STORES: Facebook (Unity IAP), Oculus (Rift & GearVR), PayPal
  (via PlayFab). See the store guides on our forums for instructions.
- added VR example scene (VerticalVR) for in-game purchasing on Oculus
- PlayFab integration brings cloud sync support for online games:
  memory only mode, meaning no IAP data is stored on the device.
  This requires an active internet connection at all times!
- added server side receipt validation using PlayFab: "lite" mode
  supports validation only (no other PlayFab features required)
- added automatic tracking of consumable products in PlayerData
- added usageCount for consumable products to define custom use count
- added currency product type that adds the defined amount on purchase
- added ShowDatabaseEditor for displaying currently stored player data
- added possibility of "standalone" IAPItem without using shop prefabs:
  you can drag an IAPItem in the scene and give it a productId manually
- rewrote shop item updating to be more performant, adding automatic
  shop updating e.g. for single-scene apps with shop in background 
- replaced downloadable RemoteConfig with PlayFab's item catalog:
  introduce product sales without app update, works on all platforms

  there is a new 'Button - Restore' prefab and UIButtonRestore script
- fixed ClearDatabaseEditor not working without entering runtime
- fixed shop items duplicating with IAPManager & ShopManager in scene
- renaming of some DBManager methods for consistency
- restructure of platform overrides from list to dropdown selection
- restructure of billing plugins: all plugins are written on top of
  Unity IAP - therefore Unity IAP is now a required plugin. No more
  separate billing plugin packages to import, this is being handled
  with platform defines instead, allowing for several combinations
  of billing plugins on different platforms.
- removed support for Prime31 billing plugins
- minimum required Unity version: 5.6.x

Upgrade notes:
- Export your products in the IAP Settings Editor before upgrading.
  Re-check your currency products for the new currency type and also
  your platform overrides since their format has changed. Remove any
  custom code that can now be handled with the currency type (adding
  currency on purchase) and usage (adding PlayerData on purchase).
